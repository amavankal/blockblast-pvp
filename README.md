# blockblast-pvp

To run this project, navigate to the bin directory and run `java blockblast.gui.BigGUI`.

You can check that you have java installed with `java --version`. If you don't have Java (as in the JRE/JVM) installed, navigate to [this link](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.

If you want to modify any of the code in this project, you should instead install the JDK so that you have the Java compiler as well (`javac`).
